# MNIST
The MNIST database of handwritten digist that has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.
It is a good database for people who want to try learning techniques and pattern recognition methods on real-world data while spending minimal efforts on preprocessing and formatting.

This is my quick implementation of CNN with a 99% accuracy using keras API on tensorflow 2. Feel Free to point out any issue with this notebook.
